Abstract: 
  
   The main goal of this project is to create an immersive Unity/VR experience that elicits an emotional response from the user. To achieve this, we will take an audio request from the user and develop a corresponding experience that matches their desired emotional state. The emotional response elicited by the experience will then be used as a basis for creating new images that continue to evoke the same emotion, creating a positive feedback loop that deepens the user's engagement with the experience.
